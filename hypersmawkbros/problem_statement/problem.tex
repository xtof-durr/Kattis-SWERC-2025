You and Bob are playing Hyper Smawk Bros against each other, facing a single boss with health $n$.

You and Bob act alternately, and you start. On your turn, you may use an attack that deals an integer amount of damage $x$ in $[1, m]$, replacing $n$ with $n - x$. However, you cannot use the same $x$ that your opponent just used on the previous turn (on the very first move of the game, any $x$ in $[1, m]$ is allowed).

The winner is the first player to reduce the boss's health to $n \leq 0$. Determine whether you can force a win if Bob plays optimally.

\section*{Input}
Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of test cases $t$ ($1 \leq t \leq 10^4$). The description of the test cases follows.

The only line of each test case contains two integers $n$, $m$ ($1 \le n \le 10^6$, $2 \leq m \leq 10^6$)~--- the starting health $n$ and the maximum damage per attack $m$.

Note that there are no constraints on the sum of $n$ over all test cases, and there are no constraints on the sum of $m$ over all test cases.

\section*{Output}
For each test case, output $\texttt{YES}$ if you can force a win against Bob, and $\texttt{NO}$ otherwise.

% The judge is case-insensitive (for example, $\texttt{YES}$, $\texttt{Yes}$, $\texttt{yes}$, $\texttt{yEs}$ will all be recognized as positive answers).




\section*{Samples}
In the first test case, you can win immediately by dealing damage $8$, so that $n$ becomes $6-8 = -2 \leq 0$.

In the second test case,
\begin{itemize}
\item you choose to deal damage $10$;
\item Bob can choose to deal any damage in $[1, 10]$ different from $10$;
\item then you can choose to deal damage $10$ and win.
\end{itemize}

In the third test case,
\begin{itemize}
\item either you start by dealing damage $1$, then Bob must deal damage $2$, then you must deal damage $1$, etc.;
\item or you start by dealing damage $2$, then Bob must deal damage $1$, then you must deal damage $2$, etc.
\end{itemize}

In both cases, you lose.
