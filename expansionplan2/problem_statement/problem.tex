You are dealing with side quests in the video game Expansion Plan 2.

There is an infinite grid of \textbf{bonus levels}, with coordinates $(x, y)$ (specifically, the cell immediately above $(0, 0)$ is $(0, 1)$, and the cell immediately on the right of $(0, 0)$ is $(1, 0)$). Initially, only the bonus level at $(0, 0)$ is \textbf{unlocked}.

Given a string $a_1a_2 \ldots a_l$ of length $l$ consisting of characters $\texttt{"4"}$ and $\texttt{"8"}$, you play $l$ times in a row; at the $i$-th play you obtain a \textbf{score} equal to $s_i \in \{\texttt{"4"}, \texttt{"8"}\}$. For each $i$ from $1$ to $l$:

\begin{itemize}
\item if $s_i = \texttt{"4"}$: for each bonus level, if it is orthogonally adjacent (i.e., it shares a side) to a level which was already \textbf{unlocked} before the $i$-th play, it becomes unlocked; otherwise, its state remains the same;
\item if $s_i = \texttt{"8"}$: for each bonus level, if it is orthogonally or diagonally adjacent (i.e, it shares a side or a corner) to a level which was already \textbf{unlocked} before the $i$-th play, it becomes unlocked; otherwise, its state remains the same.
\end{itemize}

You are given a string $s$ of length $n$ consisting of characters $\texttt{"4"}$ and $\texttt{"8"}$.

You have to answer $q$ queries. In each query, you start with an infinite grid where only the bonus level $(0, 0)$ is unlocked, and you are given four integers $l$, $r$, $x$, $y$. You have to determine whether the bonus level $(x, y)$ is unlocked after getting the scores in the substring $[l, r]$ of $s$.

\section*{Input}
The first line contains two integers $n$, $q$ ($1 \leq n, q \leq 2 \cdot 10^5$)~--- the length of the string and the number of queries, respectively.

The second line contains a string $s$ of length $n$ consisting of characters $\texttt{"4"}$ and $\texttt{"8"}$.

Each of the next $q$ lines contains four integers $l$, $r$, $x$, $y$ ($1 \leq l \leq r \leq n$, $-10^9 \leq x, y \leq 10^9$), representing a query on the substring $[l, r]$ and the bonus level $(x, y)$.

\section*{Output}
For each query, output $\texttt{YES}$ if the bonus level $(x, y)$ is \textbf{unlocked} after getting the scores in the substring $[l, r]$ of $s$, and $\texttt{NO}$ otherwise.

% The judge is case-insensitive (for example, $\texttt{YES}$, $\texttt{Yes}$, $\texttt{yes}$, $\texttt{yEs}$ will all be recognized as positive answers).

\section*{Samples}
The first three queries are illustrated below:

In the first query, $[l, r]$ = $[8, 10]$, and $(x, y) = (3, 3)$. The substring $[8, 10]$ of $s$ is $\texttt{"888"}$. After getting the scores in this substring, the bonus level $(3, 3)$ is unlocked, so the answer is $\texttt{YES}$.

In the second query, the bonus level $(5, 1)$ is not unlocked after getting the scores in the substring $\texttt{"4884"}$.
