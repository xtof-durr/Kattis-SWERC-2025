You are playing the sandbox game Mathcraft. Each crafting table of level $k$ can produce all possible products obtained by multiplying two numbers between $1$ and $k$.

If you unroll the $k$-th crafting table, you get the array $[1 \cdot 1, 1 \cdot 2, \ldots, 1 \cdot k, 2 \cdot 1, 2 \cdot 2, \ldots, 2 \cdot k, \ldots, k \cdot 1, k \cdot 2, \ldots, k \cdot k]$. For example, for $k = 4$, the unrolled table is $[1, 2, 3, 4, 2, 4, 6, 8, 3, 6, 9, 12, 4, 8, 12, 16]$.

Your friend Bob crafted a (contiguous) subarray of one unrolled crafting table. This subarray is $a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n$.

You want to know how skilled Bob is, so you want to find the minimum possible level of his crafting table. Specifically, you want to determine the smallest $k$ such that $a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n$ appears as a subarray of the $k$-th unrolled table.

An array $b$ is a subarray of an array $c$ if $b$ can be obtained from $c$ by deleting several (possibly zero or all) elements from the beginning and several (possibly zero or all) elements from the end.


\section*{Input}
Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of test cases $t$ ($1 \leq t \leq 500$). The description of the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer $n$ ($2 \leq n \leq 100$)~--- the length of the array $a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n$.

The second line of each test case contains $n$ integers $a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n$ ($1 \leq a_i \leq 10^9$).

Note that there are no constraints on the sum of $n$ over all test cases.

\section*{Output}
For each test case, output a single line containing an integer: the smallest crafting table level $k$ such that the array $a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n$ appears as a contiguous subarray of the $k$-th unrolled table. For the given input, such a $k$ always exists.




\section*{Samples}
In the first test case, the array $[4, 6, 8, 10]$ is a subarray of the $5$-th unrolled table, which is $[1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 2, 4, 6, 8, 10, \ldots, 5, 10, 15, 20, 25]$. There is no smaller valid $k$, so the answer is $5$.

In the second test case, the array $[8, 3, 6, 9, 12, 4]$ is a subarray of the $4$-th unrolled table, which is $[1, 2, 3, 4, 2, 4, 6, 8, 3, 6, 9, 12, 4, 8, 12, 16]$.
